#General
This is a general web-based messeneger application with a python backend. It has support for using both [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) and [RESTFUL](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/restful/) as the communication method between the frontend and backend. This project was created for a course at Harvard University: CS 262, Distributed Systems.

You can access a live version of our chat application deployed on AWS [here](http://cs262chat.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/login), or if you wish to run this locally, it can be done with the command:

	python application.py --protobuff
	
to use protocol buffers and:

	python application.py 
	
to use RESTFUL

There is also a button that can be used to toggle between RESTFUL and protocol buffers in the web application itself.

# Setup

Installations you may need:

	pip install flask
	pip install mysql
	pip install flask_login
	pip install sqlalchemy

If you do not have google's protocol buffers installed do so by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/master/python)
	
Ensure that protoc is installed with

	protoc --version

If you see some error with dll's, run the below command:

	brew install --upgrade openssl; brew unlink openssl && brew link openssl --force
	
Once all of these are installed, cd into the Messaging folder and start up the server with 
	
	python application.py
	
If the server boots, you should be good to go

# Description
For our CS262 project, we implemented protocol buffers and a RESTFUL API. On top of this, we built a web UI to interact with the server. The database is deployed online on AWS. Interact with the right side bar to find users to message and create and find groups to message. Authentication has also been implemented as well. You can also login, logout, and delete your account.
